# End-to-End DevOps Exam – Ella Halevy

This repository contains my end-to-end DevOps exam solution.  
The work is split into three existing GitHub repositories that were developed and reviewed during the course:

- `builder-EllaHalevy/` – Terraform infrastructure (EC2, security group, Docker, Docker Compose).
- `EllaHalevy_AWS_pro1210/` – Flask AWS monitoring application.
- `Section-5-CICD-Integration-with-Jenkins/` – CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins and Docker.

For clarity and to follow the exam guidelines, this root repository also includes logical folders:

- `terraform/` – Documentation and pointers to Terraform code.
- `app/` – Documentation and pointers to the Flask application.
- `ci-cd/` – Documentation and pointers to Jenkins pipeline (and Azure DevOps – mock).
- `helm/` – Documentation and mock Helm chart notes.
- `docs/` – Screenshots and additional documentation (execution logs, verification steps).

Each folder contains a README explaining what is implemented, any missing parts, and how to run or test the components.
